# FleischGeistUI

A GUI/HUD configuration for World of Warcraft Classic.

Style: Bold colors and visual ergonomics. Inspiration: 1980s retro-futurism meets modern minimalism. Maybe a little Phantom Liberty Project Cynosure. Maybe old physical gauges and signage.

_Listening to HAARPER while raiding is highly recommended._

# Installation

Copy the contents of this repository into your `Interface/AddOns` folder. 

_(I intend to clean this up later using only the addon config files, but for now this is the easiest way to get started.)_
